# Project 1

execute each python script to see results

# Project 2 -- Sorting Performance Measuring With Comparison Metric

run 'py runcomparisons.py' to see current output

to execute unit tests you must use a command like the following

py -m unittest RunComparisonTests.py

# Project 3

You may need Java SE 10 to compile/run the code (Java SE 8 or above is probably fine).

The basicexperiments package produces the data necessary to answer questions 1, 2, and 3 for the project.

To see results, from the command line:

	Compile all java files in the basicexperiments package
		
		javac .\basicexperiments\*.java
		
	Execute the ChooseExperiment file to see the output of the package

		java basicexperiments.ChooseExperiment
